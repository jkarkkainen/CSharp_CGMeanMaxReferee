# CSharp_CGMeanMaxReferee
CodinGame MeanMax Referee Code in C#

Tries to be as verbatim as possible, while also working as it should, and being more in line with C#. Currently should compile and work as intended, but will not be "complete" anytime soon. I'll fix things once I see need and have the time, so might not be ever. Either way, have fun, hope someone can make some use of it!
